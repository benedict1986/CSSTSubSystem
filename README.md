# CSSTSubSystem

This is a subsystem for a more bigger tele-rehabilitation platform (built by myself). This platform is built with .NET/WPF/WCF/Prism/MySQL and so on. This subsystem is developed to remotely assess the lower body (legs) strength of elderly people and those with movement disorders.

Since the whole platform is modularised, this subsystem can be plugged-in to the platform without restart the server or client. Until now, I have developed the platform, as well as two such subsystems. I am now developing the third subsystem and trying to attract more developers to contribute to the tele-rehablitation system. In the near future, I will deploy the platform online and write document to instruct other developers to develop subsystems. 

The final goal of this project is to develop a platform so that other people who are interested in developing tele-rehabilitation systems can realise their ideas quickly by focusing on the functions, rather than the infrastructure.
